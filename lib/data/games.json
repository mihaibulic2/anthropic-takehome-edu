      "description": "Game for 4th-6th graders to practice some math concepts. Requires some basic reading comprehension. Variant 1: Vertical number line basics with positive numbers only, position identification and directional movement. Variant 2: Negative numbers and operations across zero, addition/subtraction with integers above and below sea level. Variant 3: Algebraic equations with unknowns, solving for missing values in position-based problems (this has 4 levels: level 1: round positive numbers only, level 2: negative numbers and operations across zero, level 3: algebraic equations with unknowns, level 4: non-round numbers -- other variants have no level). When choosing this game, use the alternate style (state: { variant: 'v1' | 'v2' | 'v3', level: undefined | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 })"
